Word to Image App

Description: 
Given a word, display images for that word and images for each related word (like synonyms and same-context words) for that input word. Add in anything you feel could make this interesting: for example a count of images found for each word.

Data:

Technologies:
We'd like you to use AngularJS to build this. You could use node.js to serve it. Use any other libraries that you wish to use but please call out when submitting whats been included for which purpose.

Evaluation:
We'll be looking for understanding of HTML5, CSS, Javascript and some AngularJS. We'll keep an eye out for modularity, cleanliness and some level of design sensibilities. 

Delivery:
Please put this in a git repo and send it across. Feel free to do more or less than whats outlined above and describe anything you might want to call out when you submit this.
